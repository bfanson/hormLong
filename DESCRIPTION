Description: This package has been developed specifically for wildlife
    endocrinologist. The package contains data analysis tools that facilitate
    analysis of longitudinal endocrine data.  Currently, the package performs
    three main functions: 1) calculates iterative baseline measurement (using
    mean + n*SD method); 2) calculates the area under the curve (using
    trapezoidal method); and 3) contains a suite of plotting tools to produce
    longitudinal profiles.  We have minimized the amount of R coding required
    by the user, so even non-R users can utilize the package.
